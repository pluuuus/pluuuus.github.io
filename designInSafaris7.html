Proposal 1<br>
The first proposal was based on my general question of investigating the current state of existence of elephants.  Because the elephants in the wild are walking around for a whole day, the migration will also bring a huge amount of exercise. However, the range of activity of captive elephants compared with the wild is limited, and the amount of exercise is obviously inferior to that of elephants in the wild. In the A Survey of Elephant Husbandry and Foot Health in North American Zoos, the author mentions that many captive elephants have diseases with the feet and joints, and the amount of exercise is one of the ways to improve (and also change the ground material, etc.). “The odd of an elephant holding facility encountering an annual foot pathology in their herd is significant lower in younger herds that are provided more exercise.” also proved it.<br>
Foot and joint diseases can cause long-term pain and suffering to elephants. Pain can even lead to some stereotype behaviors, which seriously affect their comfort. Based on this problem, I hope that we can design a system to encourage elephants to walk and forage to increase the amount of exercise and reduce the problem of standing still for a long time, in the case of maximizing the restoration of elephants' living habits in the wild. My system is an automatic mobile feeding device. Device A is a feeding device that is placed on the ground to restore the habit of eating grass. It contains only a certain amount of food, and the food with strong smell (such as banana) in the inner layer.It  starts to move after the elephant eats the external things, and the smell will guide them walk to the next feeding location. Here, the elephant will find the feeder B located on the tree (or hanging high) to restore the elephant's habits of eating leaves and fruits. B also contains a small amount of food and inner layer, and it will rotate after the elephant has finished eating. Change position and use the smell to direct the elephant to the next feeding point. With this cycle, the routes, angles, heights, etc. of A and B can be randomly set to ensure that the elephants can be provided with different foraging paths every day. The main function of this device is to restore the experience of huge territory in a limited space, and improve the quality of life by allowing elephants to spend more time independently eating and walking to improve their foot health.<br><br>
Proposal 2<br>
The second proposal aims to provide elephants with a kind of spontaneous entertainment. Studies have shown that music (classical music, etc.) can provide some kinds of enterteiments for elephants. Based on the research of "providing high-enrichment to elephants through sound", I want to design a more non-training recreational instrument for elephants. . The article mentions that the elephant has more interest in natural, different vibration frequencies than the "melody" of human melody. My plan A is to make an irregular polyhedron with speakers on each side to play different sounds. Elephants can use the elephant trunk or legs to push the instrument over, and the photoresistor will determine which side it is on and play audio at different frequencies. At the same time, the surface materials of each side are slightly different, so that the sensitive and sensitive elephants can connect their favorite sounds with a certain texture and trigger playback again. After the face is turned over successfully, the instrument will give a short vibration feedback so that the elephant can master the operation faster.
