        <p class="description">The interface I choose is the dish washer in my home. Because I never used a dish washer before, I guess it is a typical experience of first-time user. There are six buttons and 15 indicator lights on the control area of this washing machine. Different from the metal texture of other part, the control area is plastic and in black color. These buttons are respectively ‘start’, ‘delay hours’, ‘select cycle’, ‘steam’, ‘wash temp’ and ‘heated dry’. Each button and light point to a specific information or function. There are also some audio cue to tell the user they successfully pressed the button, but there are only one kind of sound.
<br><br>
For a people who use this machine for the first time, the design of its interface is a little bit complicated and confusing. Without any previous experience, I am not sure how many steps are involved and what exactly are they during the washing process. I assumed that these 6 buttons have been placed according to a certain logical order (like users need press the button from left to right in sequence to adjust different setting in the whole process), but soon I found that the ‘start’ button which I expected to be the last step user would press before starting is located in the leftmost place (the beginning). The location of this button gave me a signal that those buttons are actually not arranged in order and I have to figure out the sequence of pressing those buttons. There are 6 buttons on the interface which means we have even more possible ways to operate it due to the different order of pressing the buttons. If the designer did not constrain the possibility, (eg. Give some error signal when user press those button in a wrong order or forgot to set some important and necessary function) it would be easy for users like me to get lost at the first place. 
<br><br>
Another problem appeared when I tried to refer to my previous experience of using a washing machine. There are three buttons respectively represent ‘steam’, ‘wash temp’, ’heated dry’ buttons without any other symbols may indicate the relationship with these three functions. Do both ‘steam’ and ‘heated dry’ are necessary or they are alternate? Am I supposed to pressed it before started or after washing? Due to the poor visual affordance, none of these question can be tell easily. Though it is a simple and stupid routine for users who get used to dish washer and surely that all the users would get used to them, I still think it is always important to consider people who never used it before and design the interface in the most clear and understandable way.
<br><br>
If I will do a redesign of the interface of my dish washer there are three main point I would focus on to improve the user experience especially the experience for those who use it for the first time: 
<br>
Rearrange six buttons to show a clear using flow and logical relationship of them; <br>
Using different sounds and different colors of lights to give the error signal; <br>
Add a timer to tell the user the expect time of washing. <br>
