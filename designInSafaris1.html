            Reading Response

            As a students who was majored in advertising, the anthropomorphism in this area impressed me most was those commercials or campaigns involved in animals. Some of them are ordinary advertisement and some of them have the topic of animal protection and so forth. One reason of using it is that anthropomorphism is a vital way of creating fun or unexpected content, another (and more important) reason is anthropomorphism is able to have empathy and feel a stronger connection between themselves and those endangered animals(or other kinds of animals under protection). Even though for many people, animals are cute, we have to admit that they are and they act so different from human beings, so anthropomorphism is a good way for people to make them more close to use and more safe for us.
Anthropomorphism seems really common in tales/stories in many culture, and it may even give children a wrong stereotype of "personality" to those animals. For instance, there is a Story called the snack and the farmer in China which is a really popular tale that nearly everybody had heard of it when they are children. It told the Story that there was a farmer who worked Ii winter and found a numb snack. out of pity, the farmer saved the snack and put it in his cloth to warm the snack with the temperature of his body. However, when the snack recover consciousness it bite the farmer and escaped. In this Story, snacks are seen as ungrateful and insidious and there are so many examples like this which give too much "personalities" to animals and .
In last semester, I did several projects involved in animal interactions and also read some articles about it.
