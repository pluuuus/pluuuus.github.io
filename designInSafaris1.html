            Reading Response 1

            As a students who was majored in advertising, the anthropomorphism in this area impressed me most was those commercials or campaigns involved in animals. Some of them are ordinary advertisement and some of them have the topic of animal protection and so forth. One reason of using it is that anthropomorphism is a vital way of creating fun or unexpected content, another (and more important) reason is anthropomorphism is able to have empathy and feel a stronger connection between themselves and those endangered animals(or other kinds of animals under protection). Even though for many people, animals are cute, we have to admit that they are and they act so different from human beings, so anthropomorphism is a good way for people to make them more close to use and more safe for us.<br>
			In last semester, I did several projects involved in animal interactions and also read some articles about it. At beginning, it is easy to make mistakes because of anthropomorphism. For instance, in my first project Nuts Camera, I tried to make a camera which can take a photo every time the squirrels take away some nuts from the platform of the installation. However this project did not work as I expected. The squirrels won't realize there are more nuts in the platform unless I perform a gesture of adding stuff. At beginning, when I analyze the outcome of this project I thought those squirrels are just stupid to realize there are already many nuts in the platform. Actually the word “stupid”(which is a derogatory term used to describe human’s intelligence) indicated that I have been affected by anthropomorphism. Because I presume their behavior in terms of human and I evaluated them in the standard of human beings. It would be a big problem if we do not try not to understand what would be like to be an animals and just design products for different “size” and “shape” of human. <br>
			As the writer mentioned in the article, though we will never know how it will feel like to be an animals, it is always better for us to try to think like animals (like “how it is like to be a bat”) rather than how would a human think in animals’ situation. When I first approach my final project of major studio I which is a product designed for dog I made such mistakes. I tried to develop some kinds of visual based “virtual reality” experiences for dogs. However I ignore a very important fact that dogs do not rely that much on their vision that much like human, their main sense is olfactory. One of my friend who are very familiar with dogs informed me this fact and after doing some research I found that even dog’s self identity is based on their scent. So I changed my direction and more worked on smell-based stuffs. When I stopped the way of considering the problem by putting myself into animals’s situation and tried to think what would be a real dog response to something, I actually got a more reasonable work.(even though sometimes dog’s reasonable is different from human’s)<br>
			Finally, I think it is not easy for people to forget all the stereotypes and approach the topics in the right way. But I am curious and excited to explore more in this “unknown” area. Human and animals are so close and also so different, it also would be really fun to think about applying the knowledge of animals interaction design in the field of human interaction design, after all human is one kind of animal.
