            In the final project, I decided my domains as “human-animal interaction” and “machine-animal interaction.” There are some exploration in different directions have been did in the process of determining my final idea of this project. I started with a special relation of human animals which is pet - owner relationship. <br> <br>

In the first prototype (paper), I am focus on the problem of irresponsibility of some of the pet owners. Having a little animal as pet is becoming more and more popular in many countries, however just being attracted by the cuteness of these little creatures, some owners have a great possibility to abandon their pets because of those troubles their pets caused. It might be messing up the house, daily-basis walk, waking the owners very early in the morning or even more. I think it would help the people who plan to have pet know more about the challenges they face the the responsibility they have by acknowledging them all these situations before they actually have a pet. Here are two version of paper prototype I did for this idea. The first one is a more physical one which is animal-liked machine which can run in your house and do exact what a “annoying” pet may do to let the owners have a psychological-preparation of the troubles they will face when they have a pet. If the user choose the cat mode, it may wake him/her up in the early morning, kick all the fragile containers out off desks or even pee the bed. The owners have to do some specific behavior to solve the trouble-maker mode of the machine. Another prototype of this idea is an APP which basically do the same thing with the machine but just in a more digital and gamification way. All these daily issue will be stimulate in cell phone(like waking up) and people can play the game (like a cook game or really walk outside) to solve the problems and bring the stimulate pets back to normal. Compare with the physical version, the app will give more knowledge and information just like why do they do these things and how can you help them. It would be more educational and helpful for pet owners to understand their pet better.<br> <br>

In my second prototype (video), I changed the concept/idea of the last stage. When I tried to execute my original idea of annoying pet simulator, I realized that it would be very hard for me to create something which is very different from a electronic pet in terms of its form. In this stage I tried to create something fun for cats owners to have a possibility to play with their cats. So I prototype a game machine based on cats’ behavior. Using the instinct such as chasing the laser points, scratching and some other behavior to active the machine, the machine will transform the data of these behavior to some simple indoor sports/game for human to participate which would give the owners a feeling of playing with their cats. Dog owners have 40% more amount of exercise than people do not have a dog, the goal of my Cat Gym idea is to find a way for the cat owners also have the chance to exercise and have fun with pets. <br><br>

Another idea I thought about in this stage was a pet-training human installation. I tried to think about the relationship of pet and owner in an opposite way. In ordinary situation, we train dogs and cat to made them changed by our own life style, to make them fit in human’s life. It would be fun to develop something which can enable pets to actually affect or even train their human owners. I hope it can be a set of wearable installation for human and the behavior of pets may affect these installations. For example if a pet wake up and feel hungry, the wearable tool will wake up the human to cook for them immediately, or when the pet feel happy the tool will give human some little treat just like what human do in a process of training pets.It would be a critical design discussing the relationship between pet/owner and human’s affect on companion species.<br> <br>

In the final stage, I change my idea of this project again. I stepped back a little and tried to something which is really based on animal interaction. Since dogs have very sensitive smell which is also the main sense of them, but there are barely product or services designed for them based on smell, I decided to make a smell-based interface for dogs. At early stage of it, I tried to make a dog VR which based on smell. For human, virtual reality is more about vision because the sense of vision is the main way for us to see and understand the world. For dogs the situation is much different, they obtain the information and senses the world main through olfactory. So it would be fun to make some installation which can bring them a real experience of outside world through scent. I gave up this idea because it would be really hard to produce “real” smell and evaluate the project. After doing some research I finally decided my idea as a smell-based training tool. A research study has revealed that dogs are more efficient at odor-citation-assisted learning under fMRI detection compare with sounds/languages even though language order is the most common way of dog-training now. I also find that the dog training now is not that efficient especially when people try to train their dog in home which is a common situation in many Asian countries. Learning the order (human language) would be very difficult for a puppy at beginning, also training is not really fun for human to do. Many people felt frustrated and give up teaching their dogs very soon because they have very limit knowledge of animal behavior and they do not have many guide & references. It would be nice to develop some tool which can be easier and natural for dog to learn and also for human be more fun to teach. That is the start point of mu final project — Pupper, which is a scent based training system for dogs.<br> <br>
Pupper uses scent as a guide in training dogs more efficiently through behavior-capture training. It consists of two main modules which are behavior module (which include sit/lie behavior, bite/pull behavior & shake hand behavior)  and reward module. Different behavior modules include specific odors that can be linked to a specific behavior the dog performed under the guidance of the tools. This permits a dog to complete the memory process more effectively. The owner prepares some small containers where these specific odors are contained. The scent containers are then used to recall the dog’s memory and command pets to perform certain behaviors in a different way. The reward module comprises of two parts: a first-level reward (food) and a second-level reward (vocal stimulation). When both modules are combined and connected, the reward module immediately rewards the pet even in the absence of the owner. Thus, these tools can consolidate the learning process of dogs. Special behaviors are learned in the dog’s previous training. These two modules will also maintain continuous participa- tion of both owner and pet to ensure a positive and interest- ing process that allows both parties to achieve optimal training outcomes. <br> <br>
The sit/lie module consists primarily of a vertical slide and a shorter shelter. A tennis-shaped toy attached to the slide on one end of the wooden pole is used to attract the attention of the dog. When the wood is gradually falling, the dog's body is also lowered until the specified behavior is performed.<br> <br>
The bite/pull module is a box with a number of magnetic interfaces on each side. The knots, balls, bite toys, etc. are temporarily attached to the box through these interfaces, resulting in different ways of playing.<br> <br>
The handshake module consists mainly of a box and a panel of deep boxes. The panel is at one end of the lever and can be easily pressed to achieve an approximate handshake.<br> <br>
The reward module does not exist independently under normal circumstances and is required to be used in conjunction with the behavior module. Rewards must be awarded after capturing specific behaviors, especially when the owner is not present, to deepen the pet's memory of the desired behavior. I refer to some of the reward methods for dog training mentioned by Stanley Coren, and decided to introduce two reward modes: first-level reward (food) and second-level reward (language). The groove of the communication circuit at the bottom of the reward module corresponds to the protrusion of the behavior module, and the circuit is connected when the two are combined. Thus, when the dog performs the desired behavior required by the behavior module, the trigger button will cause the reward module to release a reward. In the early stage of dog training, first-level rewards will be given more frequently to stimulate the dog's enthusiasm. In the middle and late stages of dog training, the voice is the main one. The dog adapts to the behavior even without the use of food rewards.
