            In the final project, I decided my domains as “human-animal interaction” and “machine-animal interaction.” There are some exploration in different directions have been did in the process of determining my final idea of this project. I started with a special relation of human animals which is pet - owner relationship. <br> <br>

In the first prototype (paper), I am focus on the problem of irresponsibility of some of the pet owners. Having a little animal as pet is becoming more and more popular in many countries, however just being attracted by the cuteness of these little creatures, some owners have a great possibility to abandon their pets because of those troubles their pets caused. It might be messing up the house, daily-basis walk, waking the owners very early in the morning or even more. I think it would help the people who plan to have pet know more about the challenges they face the the responsibility they have by acknowledging them all these situations before they actually have a pet. Here are two version of paper prototype I did for this idea. The first one is a more physical one which is animal-liked machine which can run in your house and do exact what a “annoying” pet may do to let the owners have a psychological-preparation of the troubles they will face when they have a pet. If the user choose the cat mode, it may wake him/her up in the early morning, kick all the fragile containers out off desks or even pee the bed. The owners have to do some specific behavior to solve the trouble-maker mode of the machine. <br> <br>

In my second prototype (video), I changed the concept/idea of the last stage. When I tried to execute my original idea of annoying pet simulator, I realized that it would be very hard for me to create something which is very different from a electronic pet in terms of its form. In this stage I tried to create something fun for cats owners to have a possibility to play with their cats. So I . Another idea I thought about in this stage was a pet-training human installation. I tried to think about the relationship of pet and owner in an opposite way. In ordinary situation, we train dogs and cat to made them changed by our own life style, to make them <br> <br>

In the final stage, I change my idea of this project again. I stepped back a little and tried to something which is really based on animal interaction. Since dogs have very sensitive smell which is also the main sense of them, but there are barely product or services designed for them based on smell, I decided to make a smell-based interface for dogs. At early stage of it, I tried to make a dog VR which based on smell. For human, virtual is more about vision because the sense of vision is the main way for us to see and understand the world. For dogs the situation is much different, they obtain the information and senses the world main through olfactory. So it would be fun to make some installation which can bring them a real experience of outside world through scent. I gave up this idea because it would be really hard to produce “real” smell and evaluate the project. After doing some research I finally decided my idea as a smell-based training tool. There are research shows that scent and vision cue would be a better way to teach a dog compare with sounds and languages even though language order is the most common way of dog-training now. <br> <br>
