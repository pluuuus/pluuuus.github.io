            Elephants always interested me for their intelligence and their “emotional”. I was really impressed by the fact I heard that when a baby Elephant complain, the entire family will go over to touch and caress it to soothe it. However, as I known, the higher intelligence a specie have, the easier they may feel negative (like bored) when they are living in a zoo. Though many zoo pay a lot attention on animals welfare and try to create a nature environment for them, there are still many thing we can improve. Also it is fun and challenging to design some non-hands interaction. As a result, I choose elephants as my target user, and I hope I can create something to help them especially in terms of psychological. <br>
