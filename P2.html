            <br>
            He knows he have some 
memory disease 
since some accident 
            <br>
            He knows he was a office clerk
He knows he has family
He knows used to live in a little apartment in Brooklyn
            <br>
            But he do not know 
where is this place
and if here safe
            <br>
           He feels Anxious
           <br>
           and confused
           <br>
           and helpless
           <br>
           and frightened
           <br>
           He starts Searching
           <br>
           Cellphone cashes keys
           <br>
           Suddenly
           <br>
           He finds something is blinking 
           <br>
           It is his ring
           <br>
           The structure of decoration on that ring
is really familiar 
            <br>
            It reminded him of the structure of the old house he lived
            <br>
            Meanwhile, his cellphone Make some noise 
with the blink 
            <br>
            And there is an APP which has the similar
style with the
structure of his ring
            <br>
            Open that app
            <br>
            James’ Memory Palace
            <br>
            Tutorial
            <br>
            AR scan the ring
            <br>
            He saw 3D object which represent different things he have to do today
            <br>
            They are located in different 'rooms'
            <br>
            so that he can walk along in his house, pick up objects and remember things
            <br>
            He pick up the newspapers,
Heat the lunch,
Water the flowers……
            <br>
            Oops, forgot the next thing
            <br>
            It will BLINK in the certain time
            <br>
            and he just need to Check them on the phone
            <br>

            In the process of brainstorming and exploring my domains, I found the concept ‘cognitive enhancement’ and I think it would be fun to combine this domain with human-animals interaction (which I did in the 5 in 5 project). One of my friend told me that she was in bad mood these days and her cats somehow are able to feel it and even try to stay with her and comfort her when she was in depression. It seems quite common that our pets can sense our feeling through their sensitive sense of hearing, vision and smelling while it is still very hard for human beings to sense theirs. I started thinking find some new ways to let people communicate or interact with pets. If we can feel like how they feel would we be able to understand them better? Cognitive enhancement might help people have more sensitive senses just like animals and allow us to rebuilt a way of communication with animals. Considering the problems about human-animals interaction, another common problem went to my mind: many pets have to stay in home alone boringly for a long time before their owner come back from work. If we can interact with them from far away with some certain installations, the day-time of being alone would be not that difficult for them. So I choose long-distance interaction as the third domain.
            <br>
            <br>

		Domain: cognitive enhancement, human-animals interaction, long-distance interaction 
			<br>
			<br>
			Ideas: <br>
1. Communication machine for human (improve senses through cognitive enhancement)<br>
2. Virtual reality game for animals<br>
3. Virtual owner for pets (play with them when the owner is not at home)<br>
4. Pets emotions visualization<br>
5. Exchange views with animals<br>
6. Special symbol system for huaman-animals interaction<br>
<br>

			The idea I choose to work with is ‘Virtual owner’ which would be a facility allowed owners to interact with their pets when they are not actually in there. As the design, I hope it can create a atmosphere for those lonely pets that owner is accompany them through three main ways. The first one is ‘virtual touch’, when the user touch the controller part the facility would record the pressure, scale and feeling of it and simulate it at another installation which would interact directly with pets. The second way is allowing users to play some simple games with their pets with their cellphone from long-distance. The last one is using the real voice and smell to make it more real.
