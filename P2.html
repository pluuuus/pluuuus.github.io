           The structure of decoration on that ring
is really familiar 
            <br>
            It reminded him of the structure of the old house he lived
            <br>
            Meanwhile, his cellphone Make some noise

            They are located in different 'rooms'
            <br>

            In the process of brainstorming and exploring my domains, I found the concept ‘cognitive enhancement’ and I think it would be fun to combine this domain with human-animals interaction (which I did in the 5 in 5 project). One of my friend told me that she was in bad mood these days and her cats somehow are able to feel it and even try to stay with her and comfort her when she was in depression. It seems quite common that our pets can sense our feeling through their sensitive sense of hearing, vision and smelling while it is still very hard for human beings to sense theirs. I started thinking find some new ways to let people communicate or interact with pets. If we can feel like how they feel would we be able to understand them better? Cognitive enhancement might help people have more sensitive senses just like animals and allow us to . Considering the problems about human-animals interaction, another common problem went to my mind: many pets have to stay in home alone boringly for a long time before their master come back from work. If we can interact with them from far away with some certain installations, the day-time of being alone would be not that difficult for them. So I choose long-distance interaction as the third domain.

Domain: cognitive enhancement, human-animals interaction, long-distance interaction

The domain I choose to work with is human-animals interaction especially the interaction between people and pets. My 2D design is the sketch up map of the pet-sitter installation. I hope it will make the feeling of that master is here and play with them for those pets. I think different form will have very different affect in this case. I was thinking about using projector technique to made them really see their master but since my uncle’s dogs shows no interest in such things (Tv, films) I am not sure if it is a good idea. Yet I choose physical computing and as the form. (I am writing……zzZ)
