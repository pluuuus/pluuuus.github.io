Owner Qualification Machine
Nowadays many young people are interested in having an animal such as dog, cat, bird, rabbit, hamster, lizard, snake and even spider as a pet. But some of them are just attracted by the cute or fun of animals temporarily and may abandon their pets after they realized how many things they have to deal with and how much responsibility they have to take after they actually lived their pets for a while. For instance I know a girl who used to own two cats gave her cats to her parents because she was too tired to take care of her cats after work. This is the good situation, sometimes some unlucky pets ends up with being abandoned or even death. Many cats wake their owner very early in the morning to ask for food and for the dog-owners they have to play and walk with their pets nearly everyday. I think it is necessary to let the owners know the difficulties they will face before they have their pets. So I am thinking create some kinds of machine animals which stay in owners home before their real pets arrived. The virtual animals can stimulate all kinds of problems such as waking up early, walking, interrupting and so on.
