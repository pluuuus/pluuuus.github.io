            Statement of Intent<br><br>

After finished my 5 in 5, ideas in form and public installation projects, I find myself quit interested in animal-interaction (including human-animals interaction, machine-animals interaction, animals-animals interaction and so on) and I decided to animals interaction as my final domain. I choose this . However I am still working on finding a more specific area which is not only suitable for me most but also impossible to achieve as a final project. Pet-owner relationship, human-animal collaborate create, animal observation and so on are all attractive areas for me to explore. <br>
There are many successful president in these areas. The first one is “technology in the zoo”(http://www.sarahwebber.me/tech-at-the-zoo) which using the kinecting to let the orangutans to play with human. This is a very ingenious project that actually achieve the human-animals interaction with technology. The second president I found is called “Rat Tale” (https://www.galnissim.com/rat-tale). Rat tale is an installation allowed people to crawl underneath a box and observe the life of rats through the transparent dome on the bottom of the box. This work not only enable human to experience the aspect of rats but also let people think about the problem of human animals relationshop. The third president is surveillants (https://www.galnissim.com/surveillants), a biological installation that explores the unseen world of ants. It shows the movement of those ants and the visual style is more like a ants created art piece which attract me a lot. And it inspired me of exploring the possibility of animals creating art works.<br><br><br><br>

Design question:<br>

1. If it possible to create a small natural environment for pets to play and human to use and appreciate ? (connected with concept 2)<br><br>

2. If it possible to create a wearable facility to detect the emotion of pets ? <br><br><br><br>


Concepts:<br>
1. Owner Qualification Machine<br>
Nowadays many young people are interested in having an animal such as dog, cat, bird, rabbit, hamster, lizard, snake and even spider as a pet. But some of them are just attracted by the cute or fun of animals temporarily and may abandon their pets after they realized how many things they have to deal with and how much responsibility they have to take after they actually lived their pets for a while. For instance I know a girl who used to own two cats gave her cats to her parents because she was too tired to take care of her cats after work. This is the good situation, sometimes some unlucky pets ends up with being abandoned or even death. Many cats wake their owner very early in the morning to ask for food and for the dog-owners they have to play and walk with their pets nearly everyday. I think it is necessary to let the owners know the difficulties they will face before they have their pets. So I am thinking create some kinds of machine animals which stay in owners home before their real pets arrived. The virtual animals can stimulate all kinds of problems such as waking up early, walking, interrupting and so on. After the psychology and physical preparation one will be able to take care of a pet.<br><br>

2. A “miniature nature” for pets<br>
Though there are more and more high-technology and fancy pets toys right now, it is still not very easy for some kinds of pets (like cats and guinea pigs) to feel the nature. Inspired by some very kind owners who make some high shelf for cats to climb, I was wondering if it possible to create a little nature environment which would be easy to assemble and manage at home. It may consists of a set of “basic bricks” which will fulfill pets’ different need for nature. Owners can place the “nature set” at their home and it can also be useful and have the aesthetic value for human.
