            Central Park Zoo visit<br><br>
            I chose Japanese macaque as the object of observation cause their image of taking hot spring impressed a lot. Luckily I observed two monkey groomed for each other on the rock even though it did not happened in the official observation time. (also attach the photo)<br>
One thing I am really curious about is that as I know Japanese macaques are lived in forest(Deciduous forest, broad-leaved forest and evergreen forest and so on), but in central zoo the living area of them are mainly consisted of water and rocks - to be more specific, it is a little rock mountain with some dry plants and surrounded by a little man-made lake. I was wondering what kinds of life habit made the designer decide to design their living area like this? Why there are such huge area of water and what role does it play as environment enrichment?
